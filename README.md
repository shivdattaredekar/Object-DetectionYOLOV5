# Object Detection with YOLOv5

This project focuses on object detection using the YOLOv5 model. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that is fast and accurate. YOLOv5 is the latest version of the YOLO family, known for its simplicity and performance.

## Introduction

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects in images or videos. YOLOv5 is a popular choice for object detection due to its high accuracy and real-time performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains images with annotated bounding boxes around objects of interest.

## Model

YOLOv5 is a single-stage object detection model that processes images in their entirety, making it fast and efficient. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from images.

## Implementation

- YOLOv5 model is implemented using PyTorch.
- The model is trained on the dataset with annotated bounding boxes.
- We fine-tune the pre-trained YOLOv5 model on our specific dataset to improve its performance on our target objects.
